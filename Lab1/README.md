## What is BerlinGroup Standard
With [PSD2] the European Union has published a new directive on payment services in the internal market. Member States had to adopt this directive into their national law until 19th of September 2019.
Among others [PSD2] contains regulations of new services to be operated by so called Third Party Payment Service Providers (TPP) on behalf of a Payment Service User (PSU). These new services are
-  Payment Initiation Service (PIS) to be operated by a Payment Initiation Service Provider (PISP) TPP as defined by article 66 of [PSD2],
- Account Information Service (AIS) to be operated by an Account Information Service Provider (AISP) TPP as defined by article 67 of [PSD2], and
- Confirmation of the Availability of Funds service to be used by Payment Instrument Issuing Service Provider (PIISP) TPP as defined by article 65 of [PSD2].

For operating the new services a TPP needs to access the account of the PSU which is usually managed by another PSP called the Account Servicing Payment Service Provider (ASPSP). As shown in the following figure, an ASPSP has to provide an interface (called "PSD2 compliant Access to Account Interface" or short "XS2A Interface") to its systems to be used by a TPP for necessary accesses regulated by [PSD2]:
